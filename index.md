"_Of course_," she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is a **little moxie**!"

If you're thinking to yourself, **_This is unbelievable_**, you'd probably be right.

I read this interesting quote the other day:

>"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"


>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...

>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.

>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.

>He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: _VIVE L'IRLANDE_!

We pictured the meek mild creatures where                                                                                                                                They dwelt in their strawy pen,                                                                                                                                       Nor did it occur to one of us there                                                                                                                                   To doubt they were kneeling then.


1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.
 Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.
 If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.
 Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

## Exercise 2

### HTML
**HTML**, or _HyperText Markup Language_, is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML is used to structure and format content on the web, and it consists of a series of elements and tags that define how content is displayed in a web browser. **HTML** is a simple, flexible, and widely-used language, and it is an essential tool for anyone looking to create or edit content for the web. Some of the key features of **HTML** include the ability to create headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and other types of content; to include images, videos, and other multimedia elements; to create links to other web pages and resources; and to structure and organize content using a variety of tags and elements.

### XML
**XML**, or _Extensible Markup Language_, is a markup language that is used to structure, store, and transport data. It is similar to HTML in that it uses tags to define the structure of the data, but it is more flexible and generic than HTML, which is designed specifically for the display of content in a web browser. **XML** is often used to exchange data between different systems and applications, and it is a key component of many modern technologies and platforms. **XML** is used in a variety of contexts, including web development, data management, and software development. Some of the key features of **XML** include the ability to define custom tags and elements; to store complex data structures in a hierarchical format; to support data validation using schema languages such as DTDs (Document Type Definitions) and **XML** Schema; and to support internationalization and localization through the use of Unicode.

## Exercise 4

```c#
public class Person{
  private string name;
  private int age;

  public Person(string initialName)
  {
    this.age = 0;
    this.name = initialName;
  }
  public void PrintPerson()
  {
    Console.WriteLine(this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years");
  }
  public void GrowOlder()
  {
    this.age = this.age + 1;
  }
}
```
